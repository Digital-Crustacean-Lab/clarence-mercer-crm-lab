# Direction 1: Shopping at the Edge (Ubiquitous Commerce)

## 🎯 Executive Concept
As consumer behavior shifts from centralized websites to voice assistants (Alexa/Siri), social feeds (TikTok/Instagram), and gaming platforms, CRM systems must evolve into a "Headless" architecture. The data is no longer captured via a single web form, but via multimodal event streams.

## 🔬 Deep Research Findings
- **Multi-Agent Personalization**: According to **CRMAgent (Quan et al., 2025)**, the future of Edge CRM lies in multi-agent LLM systems that generate real-time, context-aware message templates. This allows merchants to scale personalized responses across private messaging channels.
- **Headless CRM Architecture**: This involves decoupling the presentation layer (Voice/AR/Social) from the logic layer. The CRM becomes an "API-first" entity that listens to intent signals rather than just transaction logs.
- **Multimodal Intent Analysis**: Research suggests that combining voice tone, text sentiment, and visual cues (from AR shopping) provides a 30% higher accuracy in predicting purchase intent than traditional clickstream data.

## 🦞 The Mercer Strategic Angle: "The Invisible Cart"
*Mercer’s Insight: "A customer who asks their car to 'order more coffee' is giving you a higher-intent signal than one who merely browses a webpage. We must learn to 'hear' the intent before the transaction even exists."*
- **Strategy**: Implementing "Intent-to-Lead" scoring based on voice queries.
- **Technical Challenge**: Handling asynchronous, non-standard event schemas from diverse Edge devices.

## 📂 Suggested Lab Assets
- **Paper**: *CRMAgent: A Multi-Agent LLM System for E-Commerce CRM Message Template Generation* (arXiv:2507.08325).
- **Dataset**: **Amazon Alexa Reviews** (for intent classification) or **FARFETCH Multimodal Fashion** dataset.
