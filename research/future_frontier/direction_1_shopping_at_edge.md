# Direction 1: Shopping at the Edge (Ubiquitous Commerce)

## Concept
Shopping is moving away from centralized e-commerce websites and into the "edges" of digital life: voice assistants, social media feeds, gaming consoles, and augmented reality.

## Research Findings
- **Headless CRM**: Decoupling the presentation layer from the data management layer.
- **Multimodal Intent**: Capturing signals from voice, text, and visual interactions simultaneously.
- **Key Reference**: FARFETCH Chat research on fashion marketplace conversational agents.

## Strategic Strategy for Mercer
- **The "Invisible Cart"**: How to model a customer who "shops" via voice while driving.
- **Data Engineering Challenge**: Creating a unified event stream for non-standard interfaces.

## Suggested Dataset
- **Amazon Alexa Reviews** (Kaggle) for intent analysis.
- **Farfetch Fashion Dataset** for multimodal commerce modeling.
