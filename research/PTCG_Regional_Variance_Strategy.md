# PTCG Intelligence Lab: Japan vs. USA Meta Analysis Strategy

## 1. Meta Share Comparison (Regional Divergence)
- **Objective**: Identify why certain decks dominate Japan (e.g., Mega Lucario ex) but remain obscure in the USA.
- **Data Points**:
    - Japan: PokecaBook City League Winning % & Top 16 Share.
    - USA: Limitless TCG Regional/IC Performance & Placement Points.

## 2. Deck Construction Audit (Card-Level Variance)
- **Objective**: For shared top-tier decks (e.g., Dragapult ex), analyze the delta in card choice.
- **Specific Comparison Targets**:
    - **Draw Engine**: Does Japan favor board-state characteristics (Lunatone/Drakloak) over USA's supporter-heavy (Iono/Research) approach?
    - **Tech Cards**: Identify region-specific "Silver Bullets" (e.g., Hero's Cape, Iron Valiant).

## 3. Win-Rate & ROI (Efficiency Scoring)
- **Objective**: Correlate specific card inclusions with high tournament conversion.
- **Metrics**: 
    - Inclusion Rate vs. Top 4 Placement Rate.
    - Identification of "Winning Tech": Cards that appear in 80%+ of winning lists but <20% of general lists.

---
**Initial Insight (2026-02-02)**:
- **Japan**: High adoption of "System-on-Board" (Pokemons with draw abilities) to counter weak supporters.
- **USA**: Heavier reliance on "Power Single-Prize" attackers to supplement EX attackers.
