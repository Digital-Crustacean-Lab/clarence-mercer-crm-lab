## 🛠️ Action Items for Kaggle Upload (Real Name Path)

1. **Title Adjustment**: Change from "Mercer's Masterclass" to a more objective technical title like "Advanced Multi-Phase CRM Analysis: Intent, Fraud & Attribution".
2. **Remove Persona References**: 
    - Strip "Mercer's Insight" and culinary metaphors.
    - Focus on methodology: "Implementation of BG/NBD", "Haversine Velocity Audit", "Shapley Value Calculation".
3. **Cross-Linkage**:
    - Medium (Mercer) will link to Kaggle (Real Name) as "The Technical Implementation".
    - Kaggle (Real Name) will link to Medium (Mercer) as "The Business Strategy Analysis".
    - This creates a professional "Double Impact" (Author + Engineer).
